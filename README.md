## About

Curriculum Mapping for independent schools based on Understanding by Design

Periscope offers Unit-based Curriculum Mapping for schools. Intended as a replacement for products like Rubicon Atlas, Periscope is a simple, flexible database and interface for working with instructional Units and Assets. Included Assets are Essential Questions, Content, Skills, Resources Activities, Assessments, and Standards.

## Installation

1. Download and extract the source zip, which contains a "periscope" folder. 
2. Move the "periscope" folder into the folder used by your webserver.
3. Make sure the folder has the correct permissions for the webserver to make changes to the folder.
4. Navigate to **http://your-webhost/periscope/install**. You will be walked through the installation procedure.
5. That's it! 

After installation, you will have to set up Users, Grade levels, Subjects, and Standards Libraries.

We've provided two CSVs of Common Core English and Math standards you can use to get started. Other standards libraries may come later.
